# Counter Application
The Counter Application is a simple web - based tool built using HTML, CSS, and JS that allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a numerical value. The interface features a clean, responsive design with visually appealing buttons for easy interaction. The "+" button increases the counter, the "–" button decreases it, and the "Reset" button returns the value to zero, making it a beginner-friendly yet functional JavaScript project.

## 📍Tech Stack :
1. **HTML**
   <br>
   Provides the structure of the application. 
2. **CSS**
   <br>
   Handles the styling and layout of the application. 
3. **JavaScript (JS)**
   <br>
   Implements the functionality and interactivity.

## 📍Features :
- **Increment & Decrement** : Increase or decrease the counter value with '+' and '–' buttons.
- **Reset Counter** : One - click reset button to quickly return the counter value to zero.
- **Real - Time Update** : Counter value updates instantly as you click buttons.
- **Responsive Design** : Works smoothly on desktop and mobile screens.
- **User - Friendly Interface** : Large, clear buttons and a bold counter display make it easy to use.

## 📍Working :
- Initial Load :
  <br>
  The counter starts at 0 when the page is loaded.
- Increment (+ button) :
  <br>
  On click, JavaScript increases the counter variable by 1 and updates the displayed number.
- Decrement (– button) :
  <br>
  On click, JavaScript decreases the counter variable by 1 and updates the display.
- Reset :
  <br>
  Clicking the Reset button sets the counter variable back to 0 and updates the display immediately.
- No Page Refresh :
  <br>
  All changes happen dynamically using JavaScript, without refreshing the webpage.
